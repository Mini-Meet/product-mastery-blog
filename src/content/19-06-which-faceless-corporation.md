None.

We are an independent, mission-driven team & want to stay that way.

We aren’t owned by some dodgy data-abusing corporation.

We are proudly independent, run by a small founding team of product specialists & technical wizards hailing from the UK, Germany & Croatia.

From Day One, we decided we would build this company from the ground up ourselves, without external investment.

That’s because external investment inevitably means rapid growth, it means moving away from the interests of our customers - usually young, ambitious people looking to develop their career - towards serving the interests of investors looking to enrich themselves.

We’ve worked hard to get where we are:

Taking on demoralising freelance gigs, corporate consultancy and anything else we can find to fund ourselves to continue working on our mission:

Helping you to master product management.

-

This model means we need to charge for our products.

We need to protect the interests of our company, and the interests of our customers by making sure we have a sustainable future.

(Part of our drive for sustainability is also more macro-level: Once we start charging for our products, we will be making a pledge to donate 20% of our profit towards high-impact, carefully-selected environmental charities).

We have a moral obligation to make sure this thing is built to last: That it is profitable so our team can continue to work on, that we can fund growth when and where growth makes sense, to hire the best people possible to help us create impact.

But it also means we remain true to our mission: Helping you.

Helping you accelerate your product career.

Protecting your data.

Investing in improving our ability to help you achieve your career goals.
