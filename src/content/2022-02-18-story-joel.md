## How to bridge the gap to doing product properly?

I was in my first product role, but quickly realised:

This isn‚Äôt how product should be done.

Decisions were top-down, our process (or lack of) was chaotic and nobody really knew what to do about this thing called ‚Äúproduct‚Äù.

I had done enough reading and watched enough YouTube talks to be aware that this was a problem.

But wasn‚Äôt sure how I could bridge that gap - I was only in my first year in product & lacked a lot of experience!

So I decided to do something about it.

Yet, within my company, there was a lack of guidance. The lack of a support structure. And just a general focus on the wrong kind of stuff.

I felt, ‚ÄúWell, what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù

When I looked outside the company for support, I was inundated with endless resources and articles, but all of it was hard to relate to my actual role.

I keep thinking, ‚Äúthis all sounds great, but how do I practice that in my role?‚Äù

This started to really knock my confidence & motivation.



## Taking Decisive Action

It was clear I would have to do something decisive to change this.

I needed to step out of that ‚Äúrevolving hamster wheel‚Äù.

And one thing was clear:

Unless you‚Äôre learning rapidly on the job, no article or theoretical course would change that.

That‚Äôs where [Prod MBA](https://prod.mba/) was so different. It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust another course‚Äù. Far from it.

As well as providing excellent theory around product management, the practical, hands-on aspect of the programme really stood out.

You ACTUALLY have to apply it during Prod MBA, by developing a product from scratch, by yourself, through to a working, validated prototype.

You have to commit - and are held accountable - so you actually take decisive action to skill up.


## The Playbook Got Me My Ideal Job

I started interviewing during the bootcamp and I was using everything I had learnt to sell myself effectively.

I was confident, I had a clear process, I learnt how to control the interview - and came out with a role that felt like a perfect fit for me.

Now, actually in that new role, I‚Äôve been really confident stepping into that. Prod MBA and everything I learnt reaffirmed that I could do it. That I could take that next step in my career.

Not just for taking a product from zero to one in a unique way, but for any product scenario I find myself in.


## Confident & Ready To Deliver Results

I‚Äôve been lucky to transition into a truly product-led organisation. I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to do that before.

Beyond that, I‚Äôm extremely confident that I can deliver in that role.

I‚Äôm armed with a bank of frameworks & tools now, and Miro boards to help me apply those in my new environment. This gives me huge confidence knowing that I have an adaptable process for any situation.

From product discovery and lean validation, to constantly re-evaluating an existing product using the PMF Engine, I feel ready and able to ask the right questions - and help my team find the right answers.
