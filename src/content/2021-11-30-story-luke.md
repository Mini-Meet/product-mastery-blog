## Stuck In A Feature Factory

In the past, I have felt stuck in my comfort zone & realised I needed to learn & develop my skills as a Product Manager.


To really experience what building product from start to revenue was really like.


In previous roles, I had usually become frustrated - stuck in a Feature Factory just pushing features that didnâ€™t make sense - and used that as an excuse to stop learning.


At times, I felt my career was not progressing.


## Hands-On & Practical

The Prod MBA really changed this for me.


The hands-on, practical nature of the programme, combining good theory with pushing you to put theory into practice every single week, was so refreshing - and really powerful.


Youâ€™re really pushed to get through each stage of the product process - even when youâ€™re doubting your idea - building your resilience & confidence along the journey.


## Generating Real Revenue

When my product actually generated revenue in Week 6, I realised how much I had progressed!


I realised I was able to take something from start to finish in 6-8 weeks & achieve my initial goal of creating a revenue-generating product - whilst learning some new skills along the way.


## Continuing My Journey

Since finishing the programme, Iâ€™ve become a lot more aware of needing to work in the right environment to develop my skills so I can maximise my impact - and share those skills with others on my teams.


I am also continuing to work on my personalised coaching service to see where it leads & to continue building my product skills!
